      Below are interactive visualizations built on the most recent dataset. Use these visualizations to explore and investigate the data for your water point network and their functional status.

	<h2>Exploratory Data Analysis</h2>
	<p class="content"> 
	The primary data set we used to create our predictive model comes from DrivenData, a data science competition website. We believe that this data is highly reliable because it was collected by Taarifa--an open-source API for collecting crowdsourced data via cell phones--and the Tanzanian Ministry of Water. Tanzanian Ministry of Water is responsible for managing and implementing laws related to water and irrigation in the country, while Taarifa has been implementing the water-point management system there. We are confident in the data provided by both of these entities, since they are very involved in monitoring and implementing various processes for water services in Tanzania. 
	<br/>	
	<br/>
	The data set from DrivenData is composed of two pieces: a training set (with the actual target variables listed) and a testing set (with the target variables removed). We used the training set for exploratory data analysis, and to both build and validate the model, while we used the testing data set to score our model and to submit our results to DrivenData, in order to understand the variability in classification rate between our validation and the testing data set. This will help us understand any potential variability in future data sets as the values for certain variables change over time.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Both the training and testing data sets were provided as .csv files. The training data set consists of 59,400 records, and includes 39 independent variables plus an ID variable and the target variable. The value of the target variable is one of three classifications: functional, functional-needs-repair, and non-functional. The ID variable is a unique integer that identifies each specific water-access point. The testing data set consists of 14,850 records and is similar in its structure to the training set (though it excludes the target variable).
	<br/>
	<br/>
	We further examined the 39 variables in the training data set to determine if any would benefit from being imputed or transformed, or if there were opportunities to create new useful variables. During the modeling process, we split the training set into two random data sets: one to serve as model training and the second for validation. We are confident in a 70/30 split because the classification rates we obtained from the validation set were very similar to the results obtained from DrivenData for the testing data set.

	<h2>Modeling Overview</h2>
	<p class="content">
	We do not need real-time model results, or even at a daily or weekly frequency. We have determined that the model will likely be run quarterly, for two main reasons. First, since updated water-point observations come from the repair team, it will take a few months for enough new observations to come in to make re-fitting the model necessary. Second, quarterly model runs allow for better planning of the upcoming work for the next three months.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	With that in mind, we have determined that we can sacrifice model performance (i.e., speed) for accuracy. In fact, given the cost and delays associated with inaccurate predictions, model interpretability is also a lesser consideration. Therefore, we considered so-called black box models such as random forests, neural networks, and gradient boosting.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Though out of scope for the current project, in the event this project expands beyond Tanzania in the future, we would need to revisit the model speed limitations, as the amount of data and frequency of model executions would certainly increase.
