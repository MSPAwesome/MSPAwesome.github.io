    <h2>The Problem</h2>
	<p class="content">
	About 23 million people in Tanzania do not have consistent access to an improved water source, that is almost half of the entire population. Rural areas fare worse than average, with only about 24.1 percent of the population having access to clean water. Because of this, a full third of deaths of children under age five would have been prevented if they had had access to improved hygiene.
	<br/>
	<br/>Up to this point, we have directed our resources toward creating new water-access points in developing countries, through installing sources directly as well as providing financial, technical, and advocacy support to local communities developing their own water sources. Yet we have discovered that the excitement generated from turning on the tap for the first time fades as parts break, fuel becomes scarce, and wells run dry. People who rely on these access points often do not have the resources or technical know-how to perform the necessary repairs, while those who do may not be aware that repairs are needed.
	</p>
	<h2	>Our Solution</h2>
	<p class="content">Our organization, MSPAwesome, an NGO committed to increasing access to water in developing countries, has developed a statistical model that predicts the functionality of water points in Tanzania on a three-level scale: functional, functional - needs repair, and non-functional. This will provide us with the information we need to efficiently deploy our resources to perform repair work. 
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Using data related to local water pumps provided by the Tanzanian Ministry of Water and the developers of the Taarifa API, we have developed a statistical model to predict the functionality of water points located in Tanzania, based on a target variable with three levels: functional, functional - needs repair, and non-functional. This will provide us with the information we need to efficiently deploy our resources to perform repair work. 

As direct repairs are only a short-term solution, we are deploying the results in this openly available, interactive, web-based dashboard. This will allow nonanalysts both inside and outside the organization access to the results of our model in an easily interpretable format, closing the information gap that prevents other NGOs, private companies, government agencies, and community groups from coordinating their construction and maintenance efforts.

In addition, we hope that our analysis will shed light on which variables are associated with a higher probability of water-point failure, to better inform our decisions when involved with future construction efforts.

	<h2>Taarifa</h2>
	<p class="content">
	<img src="images/taarifa_logo.png" alt="Taarifa-logo" class="no-border"/> 
	<br/>
	Taarifa is an &#34;open source platform for the crowd-sourced reporting and triaging of infrastructure related issues.&#34; Created in 2011, the core of the project is an API that can collect &#34;bug reports&#34;	about public infrastructure via text message. Its primary implementation is Taarifa Waterpoints, a water-point management system in Tanzania. In addition to the Waterpoints project, the Taarifa platform has been deployed in Uganda and Ghana. 

The Waterpoints project includes a dashboard; however it has been nonfunctional since at least October 2015.
