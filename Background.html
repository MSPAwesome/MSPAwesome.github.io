    <h2>The Problem</h2>
	<p class="content">
	About 23 million people in Tanzania do not have consistent access to an improved water source, that is almost half of the entire population. Rural areas fare worse than average, with only about 24.1 percent of the population having access to clean water. Because of this, a full third of deaths of children under age five would have been prevented if they had had access to improved hygiene.
	<br/>
	<br/>Up to this point, we have directed our resources toward creating new water-access points in developing countries, through installing sources directly as well as providing financial, technical, and advocacy support to local communities developing their own water sources. Yet we have discovered that the excitement generated from turning on the tap for the first time fades as parts break, fuel becomes scarce, and wells run dry. People who rely on these access points often do not have the resources or technical know-how to perform the necessary repairs, while those who do may not be aware that repairs are needed.
	</p>
	<h2	>Our Solution</h2>
	<p class="content">Our organization, MSPAwesome, an NGO committed to increasing access to water in developing countries, has developed a statistical model that predicts the functionality of water points in Tanzania on a three-level scale: functional, functional - needs repair, and non-functional. This will provide us with the information we need to efficiently deploy our resources to perform repair work. 
	<br/>
	<br/>As direct repairs are only a short-term solution, we have also developed an openly available, interactive, web-based dashboard to display our predictions. You can visit it right now at MSPAwesome.github.io. This will provide individuals both inside and outside our organization access to the results of our model in an easily interpretable format, closing the information gap that prevents other NGOs, private companies, government agencies, and community groups from coordinating their construction and maintenance efforts.
